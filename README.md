# **Content-Based Recommendation System**

This project implements a **content-based recommendation system** using a dataset of 5000 rows sourced from [Kaggle](#). The system recommends items to users based on the similarity of their features.

## **Project Overview**
A recommendation system helps users discover new items that align with their preferences. This content-based approach uses item features to suggest similar items. Example applications include recommending:
- Movies
- Products
- Articles

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective content-based filtering mechanism.

---

## **Dataset Description**
- **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset](#)
- **Rows:** 5000
- **Columns:** (Example schema)
  - `Title` – Item title.
  - `Description` – Text description of the item.
  - `Category` – Item category or genre.
  - `Features` – Additional numerical or textual features.

---

## **System Workflow**
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing:**
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and preprocess text.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Extract features (e.g., TF-IDF, Count Vectorizer).
   - Construct a similarity matrix (e.g., cosine similarity).
3. **Recommendation Engine:**
   - Build a recommendation model.
   - Recommend similar items based on user input.
4. **Evaluation:**
   - Test recommendations and measure performance.

---

## **Features**
- Load and preprocess large datasets.
- Content-based filtering using:
  - Text-based similarity (e.g., TF-IDF).
  - Numerical features for similarity matching.
- Efficient recommendations for datasets with up to 5000 rows.
- Modular and reusable code structure.

---

## **Requirements**
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `nltk` (for text preprocessing)
- `tqdm`

---

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/content-based-recommendation.git
   cd content-based-recommendation
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data/` directory.

---

## **Usage**
1. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python src/preprocess.py
   ```

2. Train and evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```

3. Generate recommendations:
   ```bash
   python src/recommend.py --item "Item Title"
   ```

4. View the recommendations in the terminal or exported output.

---

## **Results**
The recommendation system achieves the following:
- Accurately suggests similar items based on content.
- Handles 5000+ rows efficiently with minimal latency.
- Example Output:
  - Input: "Inception"
  - Recommendations:
    1. "The Matrix"
    2. "Interstellar"
    3. "The Dark Knight"
